<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>The <a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalactic.Requirements")'>Requirements</a> trait that contains <code>require</code>, and <code>requireState</code>, and <code>requireNonNull</code> methods for checking pre-conditions
that give descriptive error messages extracted via a macro.</p><p>These methods of trait <code>Requirements</code> aim to improve error messages provided when a pre-condition check fails at runtime in
production code. Although it is recommended practice to supply helpful error messages when doing pre-condition checks, often people
don't. Instead of this:</p>

<pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; val length = 5
length: Int = 5

scala&gt; val idx = 6
idx: Int = 6

scala&gt; require(idx &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; idx &lt;= length, &quot;index, &quot; + idx + &quot;, was less than zero or greater than or equal to length, &quot; + length)
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: <strong>requirement failed: index, 6, was less than zero or greater than or equal to length, 5</strong>
	at scala.Predef$.require(Predef.scala:233)
	...
</pre>

<p>People write simply:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; require(idx &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; idx &lt;= length)
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: <strong>requirement failed</strong>
	at scala.Predef$.require(Predef.scala:221)
	...
</pre></p><p>Note that the detail message of the <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> thrown by the previous line of code is simply, <code>"requirement failed"</code>.
Such messages often end up in a log file or bug report, where a better error message can save time in debugging the problem.
By importing the members of <code>Requirements</code> (or mixing in its companion trait), you'll get a more helpful error message
extracted by a macro, whether or not a clue message is provided:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; import org.scalactic._
import org.scalactic._</p><p>scala&gt; import Requirements._
import Requirements._</p><p>scala&gt; require(idx &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; idx &lt;= length)
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: <strong>6 was greater than or equal to 0, but 6 was not less than or equal to 5</strong>
	at org.scalactic.Requirements$RequirementsHelper.macroRequire(Requirements.scala:56)
	...</p><p>scala&gt; require(idx &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; idx &lt;= length, &quot;(hopefully that helps)&quot;)
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: <strong>6 was greater than or equal to 0, but 6 was not less than or equal to 5 (hopefully that helps)</strong>
	at org.scalactic.Requirements$RequirementsHelper.macroRequire(Requirements.scala:56)
	...
</pre></p><p>The <code>requireState</code> method provides identical error messages to <code>require</code>, but throws
<code>IllegalStateException</code> instead of <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; val connectionOpen = false
connectionOpen: Boolean = false</p><p>scala&gt; requireState(connectionOpen)
java.lang.IllegalStateException: <strong>connectionOpen was false</strong>
	at org.scalactic.Requirements$RequirementsHelper.macroRequireState(Requirements.scala:71)
	...
</pre></p><p>Thus, whereas the <code>require</code> methods throw the Java platform's standard exception indicating a passed argument
violated a precondition, <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>, the <code>requireState</code> methods throw the standard
exception indicating an object's method was invoked when the object was in an inappropriate state for that method,
<code>IllegalStateException</code>.</p><p>The <code>requireNonNull</code> method takes one or more variables as arguments and throws <code>NullPointerException</code>
with an error messages that includes the variable names if any are <code>null</code>. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; val e: String = null
e: String = null</p><p>scala&gt; val f: java.util.Date = null
f: java.util.Date = null</p><p>scala&gt; requireNonNull(a, b, c, d, e, f)
java.lang.NullPointerException: <strong>e and f were null</strong>
	at org.scalactic.Requirements$RequirementsHelper.macroRequireNonNull(Requirements.scala:101)
	...
</pre></p><p>Although trait <code>Requirements</code> can help you debug problems that occur in production, bear in mind that a much
better alternative is to make it impossible for such events to occur at all. Use the type system to ensure that all
pre-conditions are met so that the compiler can find broken pre-conditions and point them out with compiler error messages.
When this is not possible or practical, however, trait <code>Requirements</code> is helpful.</p>
