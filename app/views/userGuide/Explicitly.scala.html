<h1>The Explicitly DSL</h1>

<p>
Scalactic's <a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalactic.Explicitly")'><code>Explicitly</code></a> trait provides the &ldquo;explicitly DSL,&rdquo; which facilitates the
explicit specification of an <a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalactic.Equality")'><code>Equality[T]</code></a> or a
<a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalactic.Uniformity")'><code>Uniformity[T]</code></a> where <code>Equality[T]</code> is taken implicitly.
</p>

<p>
The Explicitly DSL can be used with the <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code> operators of Scalactic
as well as the <code>should</code> <code>equal</code>, <code>be</code>, <code>contain</code>, and
<code>===</code> syntax of <a href='@scalatestScaladocsPageUrl("org.scalatest.Matchers")'>ScalaTest matchers</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to customize equality for a type in general, you would likely want to place an
implicit <code>Equality[T]</code> for that type in scope (or in <code>T</code>'s companion object). That implicit
equality definition will then be picked up and used when that type is compared for equality with the <code>equal</code>,
<code>be</code>, and <code>contain</code> matchers in ScalaTest tests and with <code>===</code> in both tests and
production code.  If you just want to use a custom equality for a single comparison, however, you may prefer to pass it
explicitly. For example, if you have an implicit <code>Equality[String]</code> in scope, you can force a comparison to
use the default equality with this syntax:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
// In production code:
<span class="stReserved">if</span> ((result === "hello")(decided by defaultEquality)) <span class="stReserved">true</span> <span class="stReserved">else</span> <span class="stReserved">false</span>

// In tests:
result should equal ("hello") (decided by defaultEquality)
</pre>

<p>
The explicitly DSL also provides support for specifying a one-off equality that is based on a normalization. For
example, Scalactic offers a <a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalactic.StringNormalizations")'><code>StringNormalizations</code></a>
trait that provides methods such as <code>trimmed</code> and <code>lowerCased</code> that return <code>Uniformity[String]</code>
instances that normalize by trimming and lower-casing, respectively. If you bring those into scope by mixing in or importing the
members of <code>StringNormalizations</code>, you could use the explicitly DSL like this:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
// In production code:
<span class="stReserved">if</span> ((result === "hello")(after being lowerCased)) <span class="stReserved">true</span> <span class="stReserved">else</span> <span class="stReserved">false</span>

// In tests:
result should equal ("hello") (after being lowerCased and trimmed)
</pre>
