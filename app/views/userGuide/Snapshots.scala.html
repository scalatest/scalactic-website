<h1>Snapshots</h1>

<p>The <a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalactic.Snapshots")'>Snapshots</a> trait provides a <code>snap</code> method that takes one or more arguments and results in a
<a href='@scaladocsPageUrl("org.scalactic.SnapshotSeq")'><code>SnapshotSeq</code></a>, whose <code>toString</code> lists the names
and values of each argument.</p><p>The intended use case of this trait is to help you write debug and log
messages that give a &quot;snapshot&quot; of program state. Here's an example:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; import Snapshots._
import Snapshots._</p><p>scala&gt; snap(a, b, c, d, e, f)
res3: org.scalactic.SnapshotSeq = a was 1, b was 2, c was 3, d was 4, e was null, f was null
</pre></p><p><code>SnapshotSeq</code> offers a <code>lines</code> method that places each variable name/value pair on its own line:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; snap(a, b, c, d, e, f).lines
res4: String =
a was 1
b was 2
c was 3
d was 4
e was null
f was null
</pre></p><p>Or, because a <code>SnapshotSeq</code> is a <code>IndexedSeq[Snapshot]</code>, you can process it just like any other <code>Seq</code>, for example:</p><p><pre class="stREPL">
scala&gt; snap(a, b, c, d, e, f).mkString(&quot;Wow! &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;, &quot;. That's so awesome!&quot;)
res6: String = Wow! a was 1, and b was 2, and c was 3, and d was 4, and e was null, and f was null. That's so awesome!
</pre>
