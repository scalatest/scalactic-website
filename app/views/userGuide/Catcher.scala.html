<h1>Catcher</h1>

<p>
The Scalactic <code>Catcher</code> class is an extractor that matches and returns <code>Throwable</code>s based on a type and <code>Boolean</code> condition.
<code>Catcher</code> was motivated by the need to catch
and handle exceptions based on more than just the exception's type as a strategy for dealing with
"flickering" tests&#8212;tests that usually pass, but occasionally fail.
</p>

<p>
The best strategy for dealing with
flickers is to fix the test such that they stop flickering, but sometimes that is not practical. In
such cases allowing the test to continue flickering can distract the team by requiring them to
spend time inspecting failures to determine whether or not they are flickers or real failures that need
attention. Worse, with enough flickers, team members can stop checking all failures and not notice real ones.
</p>

<p>
One strategy for dealing with flickers you can't practically fix is to catch exceptions that are causing individual flickers
and cancel the test when you detect them. Often this means you will need to insert a catch clause in a particular spot, or a pattern
match if in a <code>withFixture</code>, looking for a particular exception with a particular message or other identifying attribute. If
the same problem is causing flickers in many places,
it is handy to create an extractor to detect the problem. This <code>Catcher</code> class provides
a factory method that takes a partial function from <code>Throwable</code> to <code>Boolean</code> and produces such an extractor.
Here's an example:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">val</span> InternalServerError =
  Catcher { <span class="stReserved">case</span> e: DBAccessException =&gt;
    e.getMessage == "500:Internal Server Error"
  }
</pre>

<p>
Using this <code>Catcher</code> in a ScalaTest <code>withFixture</code> method would look like:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">override</span> <span class="stReserved">def</span> withFixture(test: NoArgTest) = {
  <span class="stReserved">super</span>.withFixture(test) <span class="stReserved">match</span> {
    <span class="stReserved">case</span> Failed(InternalServerError(ex)) =&gt;
      Canceled("Canceled because likely a flicker caused by intermittently flaky DB", ex)
    <span class="stReserved">case</span> other =&gt; other
  }
}
</pre>
