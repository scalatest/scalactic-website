<p>
This user guide will help you get rolling quickly with Scalactic.  First a brief orientation:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Scalactic, which emerged from the ScalaTest 2.0 project, focuses on aspects of testing that can also be useful in production code.</li>
<li>The <code>org.scalactic</code> package is included in the ScalaTest's jar, but is also available separately in a small Scalactic jar.</li>
<li>Scalactic is released alongside ScalaTest, with version numbers that match exactly. When ScalaTest 2.1 is released, for example, Scalactic 2.1 will also be released.</li>
<li>You can use Scalactic in your production code and tests no matter what test framework you use.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To get started learning Scalactic, take a look at <a href="@routes.UserGuide.customEquality.url">custom equality</a>.
