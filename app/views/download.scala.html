<h1>Downloading Scalactic</h1>

<p>
<strong>Scalactic 2.2.0</strong> (for Scala 2.11.0+ and 2.10.0+) is available at
<a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/scalactic/">Sonatype OSS</a> Maven repository (which is mirrored on the
central Maven repository as well).

<p>
For a list of the changes in this release, see the <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/release_notes/2.2.0"><strong>release notes</strong></a>. For detailed
documentation, see the <a href="http://scalatest.org/scaladoc/2.2.0/org.scalactic.package">Scalactic 2.2.0 Scaladoc</a>.
</p>

<p>
Scalactic is a small library of utilities released as part of the <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/">ScalaTest</a> project that are useful in production both code and tests.
For every release of ScalaTest, there is a corresponding release of Scalactic with the same version number.
Thus if you use both Scalactic and ScalaTest in the same project, you should make sure the version numbers match.
</p>

<p>
A copy of Scalactic is
included in <a href="http://www.scalatest.org/">ScalaTest</a>'s jar file, so if you are using ScalaTest as your test framework, you need not include a copy of Scalactic
in your test class path. If you want to use use Scalactic in your production code, or in your tests when using a test framework other
than ScalaTest, you'll need to add it explicitly to your class path. Here is the information for including Scalactic in your project:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>group id: org.scalactic</li>
    <li>artifact id: scalactic_2.10 or scalactic_2.11</li>
    <li>version: 2.2.0</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the code for your Maven POM (for Scala 2.11.0+):</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
&lt;dependency&gt;
&lt;groupId&gt;org.scalactic&lt;/groupId&gt;
&lt;artifactId&gt;scalactic_2.11&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;version&gt;2.2.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>

<p>
And for sbt, version 0.10 or higher  (for Scala 2.11.0+):
</p>

<pre class="stGrayback">
    libraryDependencies += "org.scalactic" % "scalactic_2.11" % "2.2.0"
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively you can just download Jar files for the library and Scaladoc documentation by hand from Sonatype. The artifacts tagged with 2.11
can be used with any 2.11.x release.
Jar files are valid zip files, so to access the Scaladoc documentation just unzip the Jar file. The Scaladoc Jars
do not contain a top-level directory, however, so you should unzip them in an empty directory.
</p>

<p>
For Scala 2.11.x:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/scalactic/scalactic_2.11/2.2.0/scalactic_2.11-2.2.0.jar">Download Scalactic 2.2.0 Jar</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/scalactic/scalactic_2.11/2.2.0/scalactic_2.11-2.2.0-scaladoc.jar">Download Scalactic 2.2.0 Scaladoc documentation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you don't have it already, you'll also need Scala. You can use any 2.10 or 2.11 release, which you can get from here:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">Download the latest Scala release</a></li>
</ul>
