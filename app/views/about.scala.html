<h1>About Scalactic</h1>

<p>
Scalactic was written by Bill Venners starting in 2012.
The Scalactic library grew out of the ScalaTest 2.0 effort, it is small and can
be used in production conveniently without depending to ScalaTest.
</p>

<p>
Scalactic's source code is hosted together with ScalaTest, but deployed as different artifacts (ScalaTest Jar includes
Scalactic also, but you can use Scalactic alone).  You can browse the source code:
</p>

<p>
<a href="javascript:void(window.open('https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest', '_blank'))">https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest</a>
</p>

<p>
You can git clone it to your local disk with this command
</p>

<p>
<code>git clone https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest.git</code>
</p>

<p>
To contribute, please fork the repo on your GitHub account, make your changes and submit a pull request.

<h2>Building ScalaTest/Scalactic</h2>

<h3>Pre-Requisites</h3>

<p>
The followings are needed for building ScalaTest/Scalactic:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="javascript:void(window.open('http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html', '_blank'))">JDK 6</a> (JDK 7 won't work currently)</li>
  <li><a href="javascript:void(window.open('http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13.0/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html', '_blank'))">SBT 0.13.0</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
and use the following options in your SBT launch file:
</p>

<p>
<code>SBT_OPTS="-server -Xms512M -Xmx2048M -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -Xss1M -XX:MaxPermSize=512M -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=64m"</code>
</p>

<h3>Building and Running Tests</h3>

<p>
This command will build and run the regular tests:
</p>

<p>
<code>$ sbt test</code>
</p>

<p>
To run generated tests, you'll need to increase maximum heap size to <code>-Xmx3072M</code>, and use this command instead:
</p>

<p>
<code>$ sbt "project gentests" "test"</code>
</p>

<p>What it does is simply switch to <code>gentests</code> project and run <code>test</code>.</p>
